JALA
====

Hello!

You're reading the README.md for JALA (Javascript Automatic License
Audit), a tool you can just to check whether all the javascript used
on on a webpage is properly licensed using free software licenses, in
a machine readable way.


Install
------------

JALA requires phantomjs and nodejs, on a recent Ubuntu:

     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install phantomjs nodejs
     npm install


Usage
-----

(JALA isn't finished yet, so nothing useful is here yet).

Run bin/gather to get a list of javascript URLs used by a page, and
the associated javascript web labels page, if the page has one.


License your JavaScript
-----------------------

See [Javascript License Web Labels][jslicense] and
[a convention for releasing free Javascript programs][convention] for
the standards currently supported by JALA.

[jslicense]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/javascript-labels.html
